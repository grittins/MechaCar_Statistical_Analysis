- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance as their p-values calculated are less than 0.05

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  
  
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
